As our existing license structure did not suit everybody's needs, we are introducing an improved set of licenses with commercial alternatives for the core as well as for 3rd party solutions.<br />\n<br />\n<i>We strongly recommend you read and fully understand the text before you apply for a license!</i>";

$locale['pla_401'] = "
<b>AGPL.</b> As an Open Source Community we will always develop our free and open license firsthand, it's the foundation for all of our development and those who wish to create commercial solutions must base it on our Open Source core. The commercial licenses is regarded as a supplement to our free versions, for those who wish to have the opportunity to create something extra. Our development will be for our Open Source solutions. Read AGPL here. (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html'>Link</a>)<br />\n<br />\n

<b>PHP-Fusion CRL</b> (Copyright Removal License). This is a new version of the old CRL, since the old one was never written down properly. The new version is No 1.0 of PHP-Fusion CRL and is in effect as of the release of PHP-Fusion v7.01.02.<br />\n<br />\n

Summary of the new CRL: This is a noncommercial license intended for private use only. It does revoke AGPL and the requirements of that license to share everything you use in order to interact with your users. This license is strictly for noncommercial use only to differentiate it from the two following commercial licenses. Those of you who currently have the old CRL may upgrade your existing license to a commercial license if that best suits your needs. The upgrade charge is &#163;15 (GBP) and payment is accepted through the Paypal Donate button. We strongly recommend you read the text of the license for PHP-Fusion Commercial Core License, (CCR) before you upgrade.<br />\n<br />\n

For new CRL licenses, we will be charging in Euro and the price for one CRL is &#8364;45. The license is for the duration of a domain, as it was before. Similarly, you may not change domain nor ownership of the domain, the main distinction being that the CRL is for noncommercial use only.<br />\n<br />\n

<b>PHP-Fusion Commercial Core License</b>, CCL v1.0. Our commercial alternative, the license can be viewed in its full.(see links at bottom of page) Same principles as for all of our licenses, one domain/owner and for the lifetime of one domain, with all upgrades for free. We are accepting applications from users to become resellers who once accepted as an official reseller will recieve a generous discount. Our National Support Sites will act as resellers on respective local markets, should they chose to do so. The Project Manager in conjunction with MT will decide upon the standards and requirements we will use in order to accept applicants as resellers.<br />\n<br />\n

The price for one CCR is &#8364;90.<br />\n<br />\n

<b>PHP-Fusion 3rd Party License.</b> This license cannot be bought, it must be applied for and earned. This license is an incentive to Addon developers to raise the overall standard of Addons, meaning Themes, Infusions, panels etc. Developers who wish to achieve the status of having Officially Approved Addons will apply for that status. The application form is available in the AddonDB to members who have %u or more existing addons in the database.<br />\n<br />\n

Upon application, PHP-Fusion will ensure that your work follows PHP-Fusion coding standards, that it works with the core properly and that it does not contain faulty, unsafe or malicious code. It will be a guarantee of quality for those downloading your work. It is our intention to raise the general level of standards of addons with this license, to improve quality, inventiveness and uniqueness. Our intention is that this will inspire skilled developers out there to try to outdo each other and create some really fabulous addons.<br />\n<br />\n

<b>The application procedure:</b><br />\n<br />\n

1: You submit your work for quality and code control.<br />\n<br />\n

2: We will examine your code for structure, safety, standards and of course, functionality.<br />\n<br />\n

3: Next step is to see if your submitted work is unique, innovative, intuitive and also if it will make a difference to the addon database.<br />\n<br />\n

4: Provided your work will be accepted as an Official Approved Addon, we will give you a license, Enduser PHP-Fusion Addon License, (EPAL v1.0), which you accept to use with your own customers. We will also supply you with logotypes that states that your products are Officially Approved Addons and that you are an Approved Developer of Addons, ADA.<br />\n<br />\n

You also must state that you are aware of the fact that commercial addons only can be sold in conjunction with websites who are licensed either under our CRL or PHP-Fusion Commercial Core License, CCL v1.0.<br />\n<br />\n

5: In such a case that your work is not deemed to be of such a quality that we will grant it Official status, you decide for yourself under which license you wish to submit your material, be it a free license or a commercial one of your choice, and where you wish to submit it.<br />\n<br />\n

6: You will be responsible for selling, pricing and supporting your addons, PHP-Fusion will accept no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever in any dealings between you and your customers.<br />\n<br />\n

N.B. Please note that acceptance of a submitted addon to the AddonDB does not automatically entitle an author Official Addon Developer status.<br />\n<br />\n

$locale['edoc101'] = "In this document we hope to help you find your way around your newly installed PHP-Fusion site with pointers and ideas on how to get the best out of it. PHP-Fusion is a highly customizable Content Management System [CMS] and can be configured to suit most website owners needs. This document is aimed at those who have no coding experience with a freshly installed site with default settings.<br />
Before adjusting any settings, you should have an idea of what your site visitors need. Will you need a discussion forum or not? Are you allowing visitors to register as members? Will you be offering downloads? However, there is no need to worry as all these settings can be changed to suit through trial and error.\n<br /><br />
<b>Main things to consider</b>\n<br />
".THEME_BULLET."<b>Theme/Colour Scheme:</b> PHP-Fusion comes with 10 themes in the download. However, there is a very active theme design community and you're sure to find one to suit your requirements from the hundreds available.<br />\n
".THEME_BULLET."<b>Site Membership:</b> If you are planning on allowing visitors to register on your site, there are a couple of things you need to think about.<br />\n
<ol>\n<li><u>Email or Admin Registration</u>; Only allowing Admin activated membership will help greatly to keep a tight control of who can post in your site. However, if also means some people wil have to wait before posting and that could be off putting to some.</li>\n
<li><u>Member Only Sections</u>; Are you planning on having parts of your site that are accessible to members or members of user groups only. This can be done as you go along but, it's a good idea to decide early so there is no content that you may not want publicly visible.</li>\n
<li><u>Site Rules</u>; It's a good idea to set some simple rules or guidelines early on. This may not seem important when you only have a handful of members but it could make resolving conflicts far easier later on when you have a larger membership. A good place to start would be to write in some Terms of Agreement in <a href='#l231x'>Registration Settings</a>. That way you have a basic set of rules that all members have agreed to abide by.</li>\n
</ol>\n<br/>\n
".THEME_BULLET."<b>Visitors Needs:</b> What does your site have to offer to visitors? Can the site be easily navigated? Is it absolutely necessary to insist on registration for certain sections, eg; Downloads? Do you have more forum categories than you need? Have you set the more relevant info, ie; panels in the right place?<br/>Flash files, Intro pages and other \"Bells and Whistles\" are all fine in the right place, but can become annoying if they get in the way. Try to look at your site like a first time visitor and see if it's easy to find your way round.\n<br />\n
".THEME_BULLET."<b>Basic Security:</b> While hackers do present a serious problem to website administrators, you're more likely to come across spam on a day to day basis, modern <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambots' title='Wikipedia'>spambots</a> are becoming quite sophisticated in getting their \"payload\" onto a site. So, there are several simple measures you can take to keep your site and it's content safe, secure and relatively spam free. Though, it's not possible to guarantee complete success.<br />\n
<ul>\n
<li>Do not use simple words or phrases as passwords, try to use random letters and numbers. Encourage your Admins to do the same. Keep your passwords in a safe place, preferably in an <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file' title='Wikipedia'>encrypted archive</a>.</li>\n
<li>Change all administrator paswords regularly, this can be done using the \"Admin Password Reset\" infusion, available as an Addon.</li>\n
<li>Check for PHP-Fusion upgrades on a regular basis as many updates are security related.</li>\n
<li>Only allow Admins access to areas that they need to do their job. There are certain sections that if abused could cause serious damage;<br />\n
1. Custom Pages<br />\n
2. DB Backups<br />\n
3. Panel Management<br />\n
4. Admin Management<br />\n</li>\n
<li>Ensure that those you give access to these and other sections, especially those in Settings and System Admin are to people that you trust.</li>\n
<li>Use the <a href='#l204x'>Blacklist</a> facility when banning spammers or spambots as they often use multiple email addresses.</li>\n
<li>Back up both your files and your <a href='#l207x'>database</a> on a regular basis as if your site is compromised and you don't have a recent back up a lot of data could potentially be lost.</li>\n
<li>Only use addons that are recommeded or guaranteed as safe from a trusted source. If you are in doubt about a particular addon or modification, ask first in our community forums.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />";
$locale['edoc102'] = "<b>Configuring your site</b><br />
Before you start to add content to your site, you first need to set it up to suit your individual needs. Below is a list of the administration settings each linked to an brief explanation as to what they do and how to use them. <br /><b>N.B.</b> For more detailed information, please refer to the Users Handbook, see link at top.<br />";

$locale['edoc103'] = "
Infusions are addons that you can install on your site. There are hundreds available, they're also very easy to install. In a newly installed site, your infusions section will be empty as there are none infused [installed] yet. For more on managing Infusions <a href='#l213x'>read here</a>. We recommend you only use Addons from reliable sources. There are over 400 to choose from in our official Addons database which are all fully tested.";
